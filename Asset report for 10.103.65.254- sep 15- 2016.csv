      Use ACLs to block ICMP types 13 and 14. For example:

      Note that it is generally preferable to use ACLs that block everything by default and then selectively allow certain types of traffic in. For example, block everything and then only allow ICMP unreachable, ICMP echo reply, ICMP time exceeded, and ICMP source quench:

 * SGI Irix
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on SGI Irix

      
      IRIX does not offer a way to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should block ICMP on the affected host using ipfilterd, and/or block it at any external firewalls.

 * Linux
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Linux

      
      Linux offers neither a sysctl nor a /proc/sys/net/ipv4 interface to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should block ICMP on the affected host using iptables, and/or block it at the firewall. For example:

       ipchains -A input -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-request -j DROP

       ipchains -A output -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-reply -j DROP

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

      Use the IPSec filter feature to define and apply an IP filter list that blocks ICMP types 13 and 14. Note that the standard TCP/IP blocking capability under the ""Networking and Dialup Connections"" control panel is NOT capable of blocking ICMP (only TCP and UDP). The IPSec filter features, while they may seem strictly related to the IPSec standards, will allow you to selectively block these ICMP packets. See  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190  for more information.

From CESA-2016:1626:

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language, which includes modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. 

Security Fix(es): 

It was discovered that the Python CGIHandler class did not properly protect against the HTTP_PROXY variable name clash in a CGI context. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a Python CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-1000110)It was found that Python's smtplib library did not return an exception when StartTLS failed to be established in the SMTP.starttls() function. A man in the middle attacker could strip out the STARTTLS command without generating an exception on the Python SMTP client application, preventing the establishment of the TLS layer. (CVE-2016-0772)It was found that the Python's httplib library (used by urllib, urllib2 and others) did not properly check HTTPConnection.putheader() function arguments. An attacker could use this flaw to inject additional headers in a Python application that allowed user provided header names or values. (CVE-2016-5699)
