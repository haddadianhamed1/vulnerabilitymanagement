If OpenLDAP was configuredwith a chain overlay and it forwarded authentication failures, OpenLDAPwould bind to the directory as an anonymous user and return success, ratherthan return failure on the authenticated bind. This could allow a user on asystem that uses LDAP for authentication to log into a directory-basedaccount without knowing the password. (CVE-2011-1024)It was found that the OpenLDAP back-ndb back end allowed successfulauthentication to the root distinguished name (DN) when any string wasprovided as a password. A remote user could use this flaw to access anOpenLDAP directory if they knew the value of the root DN. Note: This issueonly affected OpenLDAP installations using the NDB back-end, which is onlyavailable for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via third-party software.(CVE-2011-1025)A flaw was found in the way OpenLDAP handled modify relative distinguishedname (modrdn) requests. A remote, unauthenticated user could use this flawto crash an OpenLDAP server via a modrdn request containing an empty oldRDN value.

 * Cisco IOS

      Use ACLs to block ICMP types 13 and 14. For example:

       deny icmp any any 14

      Note that it is generally preferable to use ACLs that block everything by default and then selectively allow certain types of traffic in. For example, block everything and then only allow ICMP unreachable, ICMP echo reply, ICMP time exceeded, and ICMP source quench:

       permit icmp any any unreachable

       permit icmp any any echo-reply

       permit icmp any any time-exceeded

 * SGI Irix

 * Linux
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Linux

      
      Linux offers neither a sysctl nor a /proc/sys/net/ipv4 interface to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should block ICMP on the affected host using iptables, and/or block it at the firewall. For example:

       ipchains -A input -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-request -j DROP

       ipchains -A output -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-reply -j DROP

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

      Use the IPSec filter feature to define and apply an IP filter list that blocks ICMP types 13 and 14. Note that the standard TCP/IP blocking capability under the ""Networking and Dialup Connections"" control panel is NOT capable of blocking ICMP (only TCP and UDP). The IPSec filter features, while they may seem strictly related to the IPSec standards, will allow you to selectively block these ICMP packets. See  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190  for more information.

All versions of the SSL/TLS protocols that support cipher suites which use 3DES as the symmetric encryption cipher are affected. The security of a block cipher is often reduced to the key size k: the best attack should be the exhaustive search of the key, with complexity 2 to the power of k. However, the block size n is also an important security parameter, defining the amount of data that can be encrypted under the same key. This is particularly important when using common modes of operation: we require block ciphers to be secure with up to 2 to the power of n queries, but most modes of operation (e.g. CBC, CTR, GCM, OCB, etc.) are unsafe with more than 2 to the power of half n blocks of message (the birthday bound). With a modern block cipher with 128-bit blocks such as AES, the birthday bound corresponds to 256 exabytes. However, for a block cipher with 64-bit blocks, the birthday bound corresponds to only 32 GB, which is easily reached in practice.
