      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on HP/UX

      
      Execute the following command:

       ndd -set /dev/ip ip_respond_to_timestamp_broadcast 0

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Cisco IOS
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco IOS

      
      Use ACLs to block ICMP types 13 and 14. For example:

       deny icmp any any 13

       deny icmp any any 14

      Note that it is generally preferable to use ACLs that block everything by default and then selectively allow certain types of traffic in. For example, block everything and then only allow ICMP unreachable, ICMP echo reply, ICMP time exceeded, and ICMP source quench:

       permit icmp any any unreachable

       permit icmp any any echo-reply

       permit icmp any any time-exceeded

       permit icmp any any source-quench

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * SGI Irix
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on SGI Irix

      
      IRIX does not offer a way to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should block ICMP on the affected host using ipfilterd, and/or block it at any external firewalls.

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Linux
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Linux

      
      Linux offers neither a sysctl nor a /proc/sys/net/ipv4 interface to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should block ICMP on the affected host using iptables, and/or block it at the firewall. For example:

       ipchains -A input -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-request -j DROP

       ipchains -A output -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-reply -j DROP

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Windows NT 4

      
      Windows NT 4 does not provide a way to block ICMP packets. Therefore, you should block them at the firewall.

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * OpenBSD
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on OpenBSD

      
      Set the ""net.inet.icmp.tstamprepl"" sysctl variable to 0.

       sysctl -w net.inet.icmp.tstamprepl=0

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

      See Cisco's support document  Handling ICMP Pings with the PIX Firewall (http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/110/31.html)  for more information.

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Sun Solaris
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Solaris

      
      Execute the following commands:

       /usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/ip ip_respond_to_timestamp 0

       /usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/ip ip_respond_to_timestamp_broadcast 0

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server, Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Windows 2000

      
      Use the IPSec filter feature to define and apply an IP filter list that blocks ICMP types 13 and 14. Note that the standard TCP/IP blocking capability under the ""Networking and Dialup Connections"" control panel is NOT capable of blocking ICMP (only TCP and UDP). The IPSec filter features, while they may seem strictly related to the IPSec standards, will allow you to selectively block these ICMP packets. See  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190  for more information.

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).
